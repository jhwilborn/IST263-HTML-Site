		<h2>about</h2>
		<p>
			I grew up surrounded by computers. Through videogames and the pre web-2.0 internet, I found a passion for
			tinkering, configuring, and upgrading all kinds of internet connected devices. Some of my fondest memories
			are
			when I searched through piles of obscure flash games with friends, or explored the depths of early YouTube.
		</p>

		<h2>info</h2>
		<p>I am a senior Information Management & Technology major in Syracuse University’s School of Information
			Studies.
			My concentrations are Information Security and Web development, and I have an interest in <strong>making
				privacy
				and security simple and accessible</strong> for users— everyone should have the right and ability to
			control
			their data.
		</p>

		<h3>skills</h3>
		<p>
			I am proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, can program in both Python and Java, and am excellent at
			computer diagnostics. I am a capable writer and planner. I have served as the Operations Manager and as a
			social
			media director for on-campus organizations, so I have experience working within teams and in leadership
			roles.
