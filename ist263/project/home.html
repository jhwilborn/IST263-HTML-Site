            <p>Interested in trying longboarding or skateboarding? You’ve come to the right place. On this
                site
                I’ll give you a crash course in skate terminology, a course in how to avoid crashing (and getting hurt),
                and why I
                love skating so much that I do it every day! Why can you trust me? I’ve been skating for 6 years and
                since I came to Syracuse, it’s been my primary mode of travel to get where I need to go daily. I have 5
                boards
                that I love dearly and do my best to use and take care of given my busy schedule, and I’m happy to teach
                anyone who’s interested to skate. Frankly I’m a huge fan of anything with wheels that doesn't have a combustion
                engine.</p>

                                <p>All boards exist on a continuity between penny board and long board.
                                    The smallest board is the penny or mini-cruiser, the former is less than 20 inches
                                    long and
                                    the
                                    latter less than 26 inches long. Penny Board is a brand name, and they make plastic
                                    boards
                                    that
                                    are the smallest a person can reasonably stand on. Mini cruisers can be made
                                    of any material,
                                    but they are slightly longer and wider than penny boards.</p>
                                <p>The next size up is the skateboard, which is notable for its design
                                    rather than its size. Unlike
                                    many longboards, a skateboard is symmetrical on both sides and comes in many
                                    different
                                    lengths, although the typical size is 28 inches. Next to skateboards stand cruiser
                                    boards, which are often asymmetrical and have bigger, softer
                                    wheels
                                    than skateboards, even though the deck may be the same size. At the top end, from 37
                                    inches and
                                    onward, are the longboards. There are no limits on how long these are, and some may
                                    be
                                    as much
                                    as 60 inches in length.</p>

                                    <li>Cruising – Casual riding on flat or slightly sloped roads. Low speed, low impact, and the
                                        safest way to skate.
                                    </li>
