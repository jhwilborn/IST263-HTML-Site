                        When I first started skating, I paid $200 for a
                        very basic 38-inch Sector 9 board. It’s a lovely board, but it was too much for what I got. Now
                        I know what I'm doing, and have spent considerably less on all of my five boards.

                                <p>After having skated for close to 6 years now, I’m still not very good. I can do one
                                    slide with
                                    gloves, can confidently get myself from A to B, and can manage hills OK. I skate
                                    almost every
                                    day
                                    during the school season and typically only take a spill a couple of times a year.
                                    But I’m happy
                                    with where I am. Unlike a lot of sports, its something you can take at your own pace
                                    and comfort
                                    level. There’s never anyone egging you to go beyond your limits or to do something
                                    dangerous.
                                    Skating gives you a similar level of freedom to biking without the encumbering size,
                                    to roller
                                    blading/skating without the time-consuming lacing, to roller skiing without looking
                                    like a total
                                    nerd. It’s a far more pleasant way to get around than using a car, and there’s no
                                    better feeling
                                    than having the freedom to get anywhere in a mile radius in just a couple of minutes
                                    without
                                    having
                                    to start a combustion engine.</p>

                            <p><small>I tried skateboarding when I was little, but didn’t have the
                                    patience. I thought longboarding was really dumb when I first heard about it in high
                                    school and teased my
                                    friends that it was just skateboarding (which, it is, but it's also different) until
                                    I stopped being annoying and gave it a shot after a year. In 10th
                                    grade my
                                    friend lent me his sturdy Arbor board for a couple of weeks. I didn’t even have a
                                    skate tool to
                                    adjust
                                    how tight the trucks were, but every day after school I still walked down my hill
                                    and practiced skating Longboarding gave me a reason to spend afternoons outside
                                    again.</small>
                            </p>
                            <p><small>Eventually I knew I had to get a board for myself, so I made the
                                    trek with my
                                    mom to the closest Zumiez. In that mall an hour away I overpaid
                                    for a
                                    Sector Nine double-kick drop-through board. I didn't get my second board until I
                                    went away to colleg. I got my third board courtesy of a non-skater friend who won a
                                    contest at the end of my freshman year. My fourth board was a large cruiser I got my
                                    first semester in Syracuse. I bought it at the very end of fall, so I had to wait an
                                    entire winter before I really got to use it.</small></p>
                            <p><small>Recently I purchased a real honest to god skateboard which desperately needs new
                                    bearings. I haven’t had time to learn
                                    to
                                    ride it—I really didn’t expect how different it would feel though. It’s almost like
                                    starting from
                                    scratch.</small>
