    	<h1>Jason Wilborn's Biography</h1>
    	<p>
    		I grew up surrounded by computers. Through videogames and the pre web-2.0 internet, I found a passion for tinkering, configuring, and upgrading all kinds of internet connected devices. Some of my fondest memories are when I searched through piles of obscure flash games with friends, or explored the depths of early YouTube.
