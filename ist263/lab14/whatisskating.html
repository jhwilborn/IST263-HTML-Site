            <p>So, you’re interested in picking up longboarding (or even skateboarding), or you think you want to be
                convinced to try it? You’ve come to the right place. On this site (“Longboarding IS for you!!”) I’ll
                give
                you a crash course in skate terminology, a course in how to avoid crashing (and getting hurt), and why I
                love skating so much that I do it every day! Why can you trust me? I’ve been skating for 6 years, and
                since
                I came to Syracuse, it’s been my primary mode of travel to get where I need to go daily. I have 5 boards
                that I love dearly and do my best to use and take care of given my busy schedule, and I’m happy to teach
                anyone who’s interested to skate. Frankly I’m a huge fan of anything with wheels that doesn’t have a
                combustion engine.</p>

                    <p>
                        What is a longboard, anyway, and how is it different from a skateboard? Truthfully, longboards
                        are a
                        type of skateboard. All planks on wheels exist on a continuity between penny board and really
                        long
                        board.

                        The smallest board is the penny or mini-cruiser, the former is less than 20 inches long and the
                        latter
                        less than 26 inches long. Penny board is a brand name, and they make plastic boards that are the
                        smallest kind of skateboard a person can reasonably stand on. Mini cruisers can be made of any
                        material,
                        but they are slightly longer and wider than penny boards.

                        The next size up is the skateboard, which is notable for its design rather than its size. Unlike
                        many
                        longboards, a skateboard is symmetrical on both sides. They also come in many different lengths,
                        although the typical size is 28 inches.

                        Next to skateboards stands cruiser boards, which are often asymmetrical and have bigger, softer
                        wheels
                        than skateboards, even though the deck may be the same size. At the top end, from 37 inches and
                        onward,
                        are the longboards. There are no limits on how long these are, and some may be as much as 60
                        inches in
                        length.

                    <h3 tabindex="11">Technique</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Carving – Making wide turns across a roadway to maintain a low speed and high degree of
                            control
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switch – riding switch is when you ride with your primary foot on the back of the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sliding – Deliberately breaking traction to quickly reduce speed or make tight turns
                        </li>
                        <li>Freestyle – Technical riding style which utilizes sliding while standing, tight trucks, and
                            elements
                            of skateboarding to perform tricks on the road
                        </li>
                        <li>Downhill – Rapid descent of steep hills, typically performed with a full-face helmet and a
                            significant amount of padding. The most popular genre of professional longboarding.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cruising – Casual riding on flat or slightly sloped roads. Low speed, low impact, and the
                            safest way
                            to skate.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dancing – Performed on extreme length boards on flat ground. Involves low speed tricks and
                            full body
                            rotations and jumps on a moving board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Regular or goofy stance – If you ride regular, your left foot goes on the front of the
                            board. If you
                            ride goofy, your right foot is in front. At high skill levels, this doesn’t matter because a
                            rider
                            can alternate which foot is forward.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 tabindex="12">Terminology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bail – crash
                        </li>
                        <li>Ate it/eat it – crash, also
                        </li>
                        <li>Bombing – to go down a hill really fast
                        </li>
                        <li>Wheel bite – When using a top-mounted setup with narrow trucks, the board can touch the
                            wheels
                            during a tight turn. This can cause a wheel to slow down or stop, throwing the rider from
                            the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pushing/pumping – Using your back foot to gain speed on a board by planting it on the ground
                            while
                            your front foot stays on the deck.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mongo pushing – Pushing with your front foot. Considered limiting by many experienced
                            riders.
                        </li>
