			<h2>about</h2>
			<p>
				I grew up surrounded by computers. Through videogames and the pre web-2.0 internet, I found a passion
				for
				tinkering, configuring, and upgrading all kinds of internet connected devices. Some of my fondest
				memories
				are
				when I searched through piles of obscure flash games with friends, or explored the depths of early
				YouTube.

			<h2>info</h2>
			<p>
				I am a senior Information Management & Technology major in Syracuse University’s School of Information
				Studies.
				My concentrations are Information Security and Web development, and I have an interest in <strong>making
					privacy
					and security simple and accessible</strong> for users— everyone should have the right and ability to
				control
				their data.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>skills</h2>
			<p>
				I am proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, can program in both Python and Java, and am
				excellent at
				computer diagnostics. I am a capable writer and planner. I have served as the Operations Manager and as
				a
				social
				media director for on-campus organizations, so I have experience working within teams and in leadership
				roles.
