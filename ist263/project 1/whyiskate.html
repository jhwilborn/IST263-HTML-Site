                    <h2>My first custom deck</h2>
                    <p>After having skated for close to 6 years now, I’m still not very good. I can do one slide with
                        gloves, can confidently get myself from A to B, and can manage hills OK. I skate almost every
                        day
                        during the school season and typically only take a spill a couple of times a year. But I’m happy
                        with where I am. Unlike a lot of sports, its something you can take at your own pace and comfort
                        level. There’s never anyone egging you to go beyond your limits or to do something dangerous.
                        Skating gives you a similar level of freedom to biking without the encumbering size, to roller
                        blading/skating without the time-consuming lacing, to roller skiing without looking like a total
                        nerd. It’s a far more pleasant way to get around than using a car, and there’s no better feeling
                        than having the freedom to get anywhere in a mile radius in just a couple of minutes without
                        having
                        to start a combustion engine.</p>

                <h3>Former Fool's Corner</h3>
                <p><small>I thought longboarding was really dumb when I first heard about it in high school. When I was
                        a little
                        kid, I tried skateboarding because my best friend was really invested in it. I didn’t have the
                        patience
                        and my tiny childhood skateboard went unused until it was lost in moving houses. I teased my
                        friends in
                        high school that longboarding is just skateboarding (which, it is, but its also different) until
                        after a
                        year of putting it off and excluding myself I gave it a shot and slowly fell in love. In 10th
                        grade my
                        friend lent me his sturdy Arbor board for a couple of weeks. I didn’t even have a skate tool to
                        adjust
                        how tight the trucks were, but every day after school I still walked down my hill and practiced
                        skating
                        in a very straight line down the Route that turned into a local road upon entering town. As I
                        got older,
                        I stopped being an outdoorsy kid, but longboarding gave me a reason to spend afternoons outside
                        again.</small>
                </p>
                <p><small>Eventually I was enamored to the point where I had to get a board for myself, so I made the
                        trek with my
                        mom to the closest skateboard-adjacent store: a Zumiez in a mall an hour away where I overpaid
                        for a
                        Sector Nine double-kick drop-through board. For about two years that was my only board, and I
                        didn’t buy
                        my second until just before I went away to college. I got my third board, which looked like the
                        first
                        except a couple of inches shorter and covered on the bottom with a cheap sticker design, by
                        winning a
                        contest at the end of my freshman year. My fourth was a large cruiser I got my first semester in
                        Syracuse. I bought it at the very end of fall, so I had to wait an entire winter before I really
                        got to
                        use it.</small></p>
                <p><small>Me and that board are on somewhat bad terms because it’s the one I’ve fallen off far more
                        times than any
                        other. And recently I purchased a real honest to god skateboard that I haven’t had time to learn
                        to
                        ride—I really didn’t expect how different it would feel though. It’s almost like starting from
                        scratch.</small>
