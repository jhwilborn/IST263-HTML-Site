            <ul>
                <li>Knee and elbow pads – Protect the most vulnerable parts of limbs</li>
                <li>Slide gloves – Used for regular sliding and for downhill boarding to prevent a rider’s palms and
                    fingertips from being destroyed by asphalt</li>
                <li>Helmet – Brain bucket, secures the integrity of the noggin in the event of a fall</li>
                <li>Band-Aids and Neosporin – Eventually, a rider will fall. These tools allow them to wash of a wound
                    and
                    get back on the board without having to worry about infection.</li>
                <li>Skate tool – Allows you to adjust the tightness of the kingpin nut, remove the wheel nuts, and the
                    nuts
                    on the truck mounting plate. An essential tool for every skater, and small enough to carry in your
                    back
                    pocket.</li>
                <li><strong>Adventurous spirit</strong> – If you longboard or skateboard, you’re going to fall and get
                    hurt.
                    It’s a guarantee. There’s nothing natural or organic about standing on a piece of wood and metal on
                    wheels, and it will take a lot of time for your body to accept it as normal.</li>

                    <p>Every rider needs to always take the appropriate precautions to prevent serious injury or even
                        death.
                        That means obvious things like wearing a helmet, but also avoiding riding past dark whenever
                        possible.

                    </p>
                    <p>Getting Started: The best way to start skating is with the help of a friend. They can help you
                        figure out
                        if you’re goofy or regular, offer a shoulder to lean on while you get your balance, adjust the
                        angle and
                        width of your foot stance, and show you how to start and stop. A friend can also lend you a
                        board so you
                        can learn your preferences before you have to commit to a $150+ purchase. Before you go anywhere
                        on a
                        board, its important to know how to stop either by dragging your foot along the ground, or by
                        bailing
                        into some grass off the side of the road. If you can’t stop, you’re very likely to get squashed
                        by a
                        car.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you have a friend or not, you should make sure someone knows you’re going to practice a
                        somewhat
                        dangerous sport. As for location? You should look for a flat, recently paved, low traffic
                        parking lot. A
                        sloped parking lot is good for intermediate practice when you want to be able to pick up a
                        little bit of
                        speed without having to do all the pushing yourself, but when you don’t have full control over
                        your
                        board then it’s a recipe for disaster. A recently paved parking lot will make the ride much more
                        comfortable. Your feet will tingle uncomfortably from the vibrations until they get used to it.
                        A craggy
                        parking lot also makes it a lot likelier that you’ll hit a gap where your wheel gets stuck, and
                        you’re
                        launched off your board. Finally, you should always strive to ride in low traffic areas. If
                        you’re
                        commuting, it may not always be possible, but cars are your number one source of danger. There
                        are many
                        respectful and cautious drivers, but even they might not always see you. There are also far too
                        many
                        careless drivers who have no interest in preserving the lives of pedestrians, bicyclists, or
                        longboarders. When you’re not entirely comfortable on a board, you want to stay as far away from
                        cars as
                        possible, including when in parking lots.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you get your bearings on a board and start to feel comfortable enough to get on the road,
                        always
                        make sure you go out with a helmet, pads, water, and a means to contact someone for help if you
                        get in
                        trouble. Skating is so much faster than walking that you can get a lot further from where you
                        started
                        than you intended. It’s also a good idea to have a route or area you want to skate in mind
                        before you
                        leave, and that you know the area and the quality of the roads, as well as the levels of vehicle
                        traffic. You should avoid steep roads, especially ones with intersections. You should always
                        wear a
                        highly visible shirt and helmet, especially if its close to sunset. Riding after the sun sets is
                        dangerous and ill advised, and if you’re going to do it you at the very least should bring
                        reflective
                        clothing and a headlamp.

                    <h2 tabindex="11">What kind of board to buy, and what is the right price?</h2>
                    <p>A reasonable price for a complete board set will typically cost between $120 and $200, depending
                        on
                        brand
                        and style. A basic flat double-kick drop-through longboard should not run you more than $160. If
                        you
                        pay
                        more than that, its too much. Places like Zumiez are OK to shop at, but their corporate mandate
                        is
                        to
                        overcharge beginners for gear they don’t understand. When I first started skating, I paid $200
                        for a
                        very basic 38-inch sector 9 board. It’s a lovely board, but it was too much for what I got.
                        Underpaying
                        for a board is dangerous for a lot of reasons. The deck could break, of course, leaving you with
                        splinters and a hole in your heart. The bearings could lock, throwing you from the board at high
                        speed
                        (Example: my friend once won a knock-off tiny penny board in a competition. It was entirely
                        unusable
                        because the wheels hardly spun), and the materials might be low quality such that the board is
                        rendered
                        unusable in just a couple of years due to wear and tear. A good board that is well maintained
                        can
                        last
                        many years, making spending more money a better idea than getting something on Amazon for $50
                        that
                        will
                        hurt you. My first board is more than 5 years old and is still in great condition.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>I recommend buying a flat board with drop-through trucks. You will be closer to the
                            ground,
                            which means
                            you’ll be safer and get less tired from pushing. </strong>You won’t have to worry about
                        wheel-bite or other
                        dangers of top-mounted decks. You’ll have a nice, relaxed standing platform that won’t hurt your
                        feet.
                        Other common starter boards are pin tails, which are very long flat boards that end in a sharp
                        point,
                        and cruisers: top-mounts that come with a kick tail enabling some skateboard-style tricks.
                        What about accessories and gear?
                    </p>
                    <p>For protective gear: Knee and elbow pads, wrist guards, a helmet, and jeans. Pads and wrist
                        guards
                        are
                        typically sold in a set, and you should do some significant research on what will fit you if
                        you’re
                        going to buy online. Skating is unfortunately a hobby that involves a lot of online purchasing
                        if
                        you’re
                        not lucky enough to have a skate shop local to you. A helmet is non-negotiable. As you get more
                        comfortable on a board, whether you wear a helmet is your choice. But as a beginner, choosing
                        not to
                        wear a helmet is absolutely idiotic: you will fall, and you will get a concussion. Tough jeans
                        are a
                        great addition- they will limit the amount of road burn you end up with on your legs and hips,
                        and
                        you
                        don’t even have to pay for pre-ripped ones if you fall enough! Slide gloves are optional,
                        especially
                        as
                        they’re more useful for advanced maneuvers than they are for beginners. But they do help keep
                        your
                        hands
                        safe.
                        Other accessories: To start, all you need is a skate tool. Get one that’s entirely made of
                        metal,
                        otherwise the plastic will bend and warp when you’re trying to loosen a bolt that was put on a
                        bit
                        too
                        tight by the manufacturer. You will eventually need to replace your skate hardware as it gets
                        rusty
                        and
                        as your bearings fill with gunk, but that will happen down the line and isn’t something you need
                        to
                        worry about initially.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Trucks – The metal fixtures that attach to the bottom of the deck
                        </li>
                        <li>Drop-through vs top-mount – Drop through trucks split in half. The top half screws into the
                            top
                            of
                            the deck, and the bottom half into the bottom of the deck. A deck must be specifically built
                            to
                            accommodate a drop through setup. The result of using a drop through setup is a more stable
                            ride
                            that is lower to the ground. Top mount trucks situate the entire apparatus beneath the board
                            with
                            attachment screws being the only part that are on the top of the deck. Top mounted setups
                            get
                            you
                            higher off of the ground and allow for a narrower hanger width.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hangers – Hangers are the metal elements on the outside of the trucks. They are where the
                            wheels
                            are
                            mounted and secured.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kingpin – The kingpin is a large nut that goes on the outside of the truck to secure the
                            mounting
                            plate and the rest of the truck together. The kingpin also keeps the bushings in place.
                            Adjusting
                            the tension of the kingpin is used to modify whether the trucks are “tight” or “loose”,
                            which
                            governs how quickly the board can turn and how stable it is.</li>
                        <li>Riser – A pad that can be applied underneath or on top of trucks in order to raise the board
                            further
                            off of the ground</li>
                        <li>Bushings – Small pieces of polyurethane that rest inside of the trucks. They come in
                            different
                            shapes and hardness levels which determine turning speed and response</li>
                        <li>Regular vs reverse – Trucks can be mounted with the kingpin facing outwards (reverse) or
                            inwards
                            (regular). Typically skateboards use regular trucks while longboards use reverse.</li>
                        <li>Wheels – The polyurethane cylinders that attach to the trucks and enable movement</li>
                        <li>Size and durometer – Larger wheels accelerate more slowly but hold speed for longer. They
                            provide
                            more surface area so they grip the road better, and are generally safer and more
                            comfortable.
                            Softer
                            wheels grip better and ride more quietly than harder wheels. Harder wheels give more
                            opportunities
                            for breaking traction with the road, allowing for tricks like sliding.</li>
                        <li>Bearings – Bearings are small metal tubes that contain tiny, lubricated elements which allow
                            a
                            wheel
                            to freely rotate on an axel.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Deck – The plank of wood, carbon fiber (yes really), or plastic that the rider stands on
                        </li>
                        <li>Kicktails – A kicktail is an upward-curved section of wood at the end of a board that allows
                            a
                            rider
                            to get additional leverage, letting them raise the nose (front) or tail (rear) of the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>Concave - A deliberate warp in a board that places the center of a rider’s feet lower than
                            their
                            heels and toes, making them less likely to slip off the board.</li>
                        <li>Flex – How bendy a board is. A bendier board can be more fun or lively, but will steal more
                            energy
                            from each push than a stiff board.</li>
                        <li>Grip tape – Essentially sandpaper. Provides friction to keep the rider from falling off of
                            the
                            board. Very rough on the hands, especially when brand new.</li>
                        <li>Wheelbase – The distance between the front and back wheels. A longer wheelbase provides more
                            stability, but worse turning. A shorter wheelbase makes a board much less stable but grants
                            it a
                            great deal of agility without requiring extremely loose trucks.</li>
