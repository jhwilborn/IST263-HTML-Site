    Jason Wilborn 
    
    I am a senior Information Management & Technology major in Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies. My concentrations are Information Security and Web development, and I have an interest in making privacy and security simple and accessible for users—everyone should have the right and ability to control their data. 

    I am proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, can program in both Python and Java, and am excellent at computer diagnostics. I am a capable writer and planner. I have served as the Operations Manager and as a social media director for on-campus organizations, so I have experience working within teams and in leadership roles.
    
    I enjoy skateboarding, kayaking, podcasts, audiobooks, and music when I’m not immersed in the above activities.
